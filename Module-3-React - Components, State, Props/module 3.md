1. What is React Js?
React Js is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the user interface when the underlying data changes. React follows a component-based architecture and uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) for efficient rendering.

2. What is NPM in React Js?
NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is used to install, upgrade, and manage third-party libraries and dependencies in a React Js project. NPM provides a command-line interface that allows developers to install packages from the official NPM registry or from a specific package.json file.

3. What is the Role of Node Js in React Js?
Node Js is a server-side JavaScript runtime en
3vironment. In the context of React Js, Node Js is commonly used as a development server or to run build processes and compile React components. It provides an ecosystem of tools and libraries that make it easier to develop, test, and deploy React Js applications.

4. What is CLI command In React Js?
CLI stands for Command Line Interface. In React Js, the CLI command refers to the command-line tools used to create, build, and manage React Js applications. The most popular CLI tool for React Js is Create React App (CRA), which provides a preconfigured development environment and project structure.

5. What are Components in React Js?
Components in React Js are building blocks of the user interface. They can be considered as independent and reusable building blocks that are composed together to create complex UIs. React Js supports two types of components: functional components and class components. Functional components are simpler and rely on JavaScript functions, while class components are more powerful and have additional features like state and lifecycle methods.

6. What are Header and Content Components in React Js?
Header and Content components are common examples of UI components in React Js. The Header component typically contains the top part of a webpage or application, such as the logo, navigation menu, and user account information. The Content component, on the other hand, holds the main content of the webpage or application, which can vary based on the specific use case.

7. How to install React Js on Windows and Linux Operating System?
To install React Js on Windows and Linux operating systems, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node Js installed on your system. You can check by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   node -v
   ```

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the desired directory where you want to create your React Js project.

3. Install Create React App (CRA) globally by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install create-react-app
   ```

4. Once CRA is installed, create a new React Js project by running the following command:
   ```
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```

5. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd my-app
   ```

6. Start the development server by running the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

Now, you have successfully installed React Js and created a new project. You can access your React application by opening a web browser and visiting `http://localhost:3000`.

8. How to install NPM and check its version?
NPM (Node Package Manager) is installed along with Node Js. To check the version of NPM, you can use the following command in your terminal:
```
npm -v
```
This will display the version of NPM installed on your system.

9. How to check the version of React Js?
To check the version of React Js in your project, you can navigate to the root directory of your React project and open the `package.json` file. Inside the file, you will find a `"react"` dependency with its version specified. Alternatively, you can also run the following command in your terminal within the project directory:
```
npm list react
```
This will display the version of React Js installed in your project.

10. Create Increment decrement state change by button click?

  const handlechangei = () => {
    updatex(x + 1);
  }
  const handlechanged = () => {
    updatex(x - 1);
  }



  return (
    <div>
      <div><h1>{x}</h1></div>
      <button onClick={handlechangei}>Increment x</button>
      <button onClick={handlechanged}>Decrement x</button>
    </div>
